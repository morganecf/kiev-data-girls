Workflow

- explore text
- clean text/remove emojis/labeling
- explore cleaned text

NLP/Pandas Concepts
- columns, rows
- dataframes vs. series
- indexes
- grouping and aggregation
- summary statistics
- distributions and plotting
- text extraction - hashtags and mentions (regex)
- n-grams, word vectors, bag of words
- lemmas

Feature extraction
- bag of words
- POS tagging
  --> as used in paper
- using equivalence class for URL/USERNAME/etc
  --> view effects of using and not using them
- repeated letters
  --> paper normalizes all repeated letters to 2
  --> could also see difference between doing this (keeping as new token that potentially
      has exaggerated/polarizing effect) and having separate feature
  --> or could add indicator to word
    love_<# of repeated letters>
    looooveeee => love2 (or love6)
  --> similar strategy for misspellings
    love_SIC

- remove tweets with both emoticons
- remove retweets

- using more than just :) and :(
  - :D >:( etc.?
  - see mapping in paper

- using classifier, analyze sentiment over time related to a particular hashtag
  - normalize query terms
  - ex: movie, book, event, politics,
